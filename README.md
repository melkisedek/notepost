A multi-user events noticeboard for campus organisations
    by Melkisedek Hamakali

# PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION

The Polytechnic of Namibia uses notice boards for informing students of events happening in the institution.
These are a good traditional way of giving information to students.
However at times it can be inadequate, for example
- some students don't read the notices because of many reasons such as busy schedules, distance education and absenteeism.
- They could read about some of the events on the polytechnic website but unfortunately many social events are not shown there.
- Some notices are badly designed and do not attract student attention even when they have important information such as lecture times, test dates etc.

# PROPOSED SOLUTION

My proposed solution is to build a multi-user program that allows lecturers, SRCs and anyone with authority over notice boards to sent messages to a central place where they can be easily controlled. It should allow them to do the following:
- Allow students to have a central place to view all notices
- Make setting up a notice as easy as possible without having to teach the customers new skills.

# OTHER SOLUTIONS

I don't know of many programs that try to fix this problem. It can also be solved by
using:
- Oracle's apex but apex also provides too many features which I would never use for small project.
- We could build a complete website with Content Management Systems to manage notices however the learning overhead (for developer and customer) might delay the project more than necessary.

# FEASIBILITY OF PROPOSED SOLUTION

My solution is feasible because:
- I already know C programming and will not be delayed in beginning of the project.
- The c programming language is simple and does not offer many complicated frameworks and classes. 
  This is good for the project because the project doesn't require many of the advanced features.
